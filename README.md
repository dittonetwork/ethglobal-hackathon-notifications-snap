# Dear MetaMask Team!
## Small remark as we could not explain to you in person :) 

### In order to see our snap in action you need to deploy the scripts from [CCIP](https://github.com/dittonetwork/ethglobal-hackathon-interchain/tree/main/script/CCIP) or [Hyperlane](https://github.com/dittonetwork/ethglobal-hackathon-interchain/tree/main/script/Hyperlane) with the same private key as the on ein the metamask that has our snap installed. Then you could view the smart contract balances that your private key owns on multiple blockchains.

Thank you for your consideration!
